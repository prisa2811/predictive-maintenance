# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Problem Statement
Predict equipment failures to perform maintenance proactively and reduce downtime.

## Data
- [NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository)

## Process
1. Data Collection and EDA
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building
4. Evaluation
5. Visualization

## Results
- Model achieved an accuracy of X%, with a precision of Y% and recall of Z%.
- The ROC-AUC score is W%.

## Visualizations
- ![Feature Importance](results/feature_importance.png)
- ![ROC Curve](results/roc_curve.png)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the scripts: `python scripts/preprocess.py` and `python scripts/train.py`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to predict equipment failures using machine learning techniques, which can help in performing proactive maintenance.
